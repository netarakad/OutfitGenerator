# OutfitGenerator

DESCRIPTION
But first, Fashion!
For my term project, I created an outfit generator that allows the user to import image files of their clothes and create outfits to store. Based on the outfits it stores, I created a rating algorithm that takes in winter colors (red, blue) and weather data to determine if it makes a good outfit for the given day. takes in weather data from a weather API and generates possible outfit combinations.
